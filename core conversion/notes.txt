Should be creating make files and other associated build scripts to do conversions, installs, upgrades, etc.

Certain scripts should still be seperate from run.c, as run.c should manage system and calls, where a seperate script should manage the playback of content, regardless of what the rest of the system is doing.

Need to review current code and determine logic and structure of conversion applications / system.

MQTT references for core conversion can be found within MQTT repositories, although specific code references can be found in noo-ebs on local drive, at:
/home/kevin/workspace/noo-ebs/ref_code/mqtt

Also, possible future for AEBL expansion, being open stack or similar:

This may have been mentioned in another part of AEBL project, but the AEBL project will establish a temporary server to handle messaging, etc until such a time that it is converted to P2P / cloud

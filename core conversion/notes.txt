Should be creating make files and other associated build scripts to do conversions, installs, upgrades, etc.

Certain scripts should still be seperate from run.c, as run.c should manage system and calls, where a seperate script should manage the playback of content, regardless of what the rest of the system is doing.

Need to review current code and determine logic and structure of conversion applications / system.

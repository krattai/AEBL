                           Compilation and Installation

Quick Start:
	If you're in a hurry to see ticker, just run "make test" now --
	ticker will be compiled and will run.
	Then, read the rest of this file. :-)

Libraries:
	To build the program, you will need the slang library. This can be
	found at ftp://space.mit.edu/pub/davis/slang/

Configuration:
	Ticker uses an autoconf configure script. Typically, if you want
	the ticker binaries installed in /usr/bin, you should type:

		./configure --prefix=/usr

	To get a list of all the possible arguments the configure script can
	use, type:

		./configure --help

	Note that if you have slang installed in a nonstandard location, you
	might need to set two variables before you are run ./configure in
	the next step:

		SLANG_LIB_LOC	Set this to the directory where the slang
				libraries are located.
		SLANG_H_LOC	Set this to the filename where slang.h is
				located.

	After running configure, you might want to take a look at
	makeinfo, which is part of Ticker's makefile - there are a few
	options you can turn on there. You can also look at
	config.h and modify some things there. This is optional.

Compilation:
	To build Ticker, type:

		make

Testing:
	To try out the program before installing it, type:

		make test

Installation:
	To install Ticker, become root and type:

		make install

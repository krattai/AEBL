=head3 decode_decryot_reformat

decode from quoted-printable (Yahoo), decrypt (verfiy signature) and reformat from base64 (Gmail)
there's probably quite a few variations of this, therefore systems are going to have choose/restrict
mail providers or face a lot of complexity in this bit.

The jabber etc. doesn't need the mime decoding, but I've kept for the moment, since all the logic is
pretty much roughed out anyway...everything should really take place /tmp and be cleared out asap,
since there are currently plaintext transactions in there...

Currently tested for Yahoo and Gmail, for obvious reasons, I don't care about hotmail

=head3 encrypt_and_sign_notifications

FIXME: encrypt and sign the receipt using a public key collected from the id in the originator record...either this key
is on a local keyring (done) or can be accessed from the chosen keyserver (not done or tested). These are implementatation 'gaps' or choices
at present...

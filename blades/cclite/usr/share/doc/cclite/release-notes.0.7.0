Release notes for Cclite 0.7.0


Major changes:

1. Jquery and jquery based javascript replaces previous javascript, give a better 'future' too
2. Web control panel + integration for most of the batch scripts, this makes things easier for commodity hosting
3. Manual updated in detail, return to A4 format
4. Simpler install, often, only the Mysql database user and password needs changing
5. Testing done with Selenium on Ubunutu, Fedora virtual host and Cpanel (krystal.co.uk)
6. SMS gateway tidied up and tested
7. Explanatory tooltips in many places
8. Database install should both work from application and manually (via phpadmin)
9. About 60 bugfixes (but there shouldn't be 60 bugs, should there...)
10. Batch directories and mail, per registry not per install (gradually getting towards 'better' multiregistry)
11. CARP added in many places to give more web-based explanation on error
12. cpanel specific build added to give a specific tarball.
13. Current template changed to improve readibility at top
14. Ccconfiguration used for configuration, instead of duplicated configuration function
15. lib path hardcoded as relative in all top level scripts
16. Use Net::SMTP and Net::POP3 instead of Mail::Sendmail so that there's client/server for mail transactions etc.

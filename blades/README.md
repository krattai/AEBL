blades
======

Blades are AEBL addons which add functionality to an AEBL, without actually interfering with the base function of the device.

These might include backend services such as web interfaces, messaging services, tunneling, smart phone interfaces, or even controller interfaces which utilize the GPIO pins of an AEBL on a Raspberry Pi or similar devices.

This is a great way for people to help with and add to the project, which enhances the device in innovative ways.

It is important to note that we have tested owncloud on AEBL and it does work.  Also, xtreemfs is known to work on the Raspberry Pi platform.

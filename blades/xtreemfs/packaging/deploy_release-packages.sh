Usage:
  $0 <dist-dir> unstable|testing|stable [nocommit]

Available "targets":
  unstable  = beta versions which contain latest changes
  testing   = only used for testing a release
  stable    = stable releases only

If 'nocommit' is specified, the generated files will be kept in the temporary
directory and not commited to the OpenSuse build service.
This is useful for building a package locally.

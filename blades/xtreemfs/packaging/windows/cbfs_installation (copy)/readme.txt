The current XtreemFS Windows Client has no graphical user interface (GUI).
Therefore you have to run "mount.xtreemfs" from the command line to mount a volume.

For example, to mount the volume "demo" of our public demo server
"demo.xtreemfs.org" at drive letter X: type the following command:

      mount.xtreemfs demo.xtreemfs.org/demo X:

Run "mount.xtreemfs --help" to retrieve the full list of available options.

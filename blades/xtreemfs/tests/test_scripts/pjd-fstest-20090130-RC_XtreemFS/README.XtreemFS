This directory contains the POSIX file system test suite, obtained from: http://www.tuxera.com/community/posix-test-suite/

Additionally, some changes were applied:
- Some tests were disabled (by renaming them from xx.t to xx.t.<reason>, e.g. tests/chmod/02.t.length) as they do not apply to XtreemFS.
- Also, the "mkfifo" and "xacl" directories were moved from the "tests" directory to the parent directory to disable them.
- FIFO related test sequences were disabled by substituting "except" and "test_check" with its newly added "_noop" variants.

In order to successfully run the POSIX Test Suite on a XtreemFS volume, the following conditions must be met:
- volume must be created with option --chown-non-root
- volume must be mounted with option -o allow_other
- tests have to be executed as root

To execute the tests, change to the to be tested XtreemFS directory first and run
$ prove -r tests

Install
=======

PACKAGE
RaspCTL has a debian packaged in a public repo. Follow the instructions given in the official webpage (http://raspctl.com).
This is the BEST and easyest way of installing RaspCTL.

Or you can simply try to install it by yourself manually (hard way):

DEPENDENCIES
Required system packages:
	$ sudo aptitude install python-bottle mercurial

Required if you want to use the webcam:
	$ sudo aptitude install fswebcam

USER
This application MUST run as non-privileged user. It is possible to run it
as root but is strongly discouraged. You can create other user different
than "pi" if you want.

GROUPS
Make sure that you user is in the video and audio groups:
	$ sudo adduser $USER video
	$ sudo adduser $USER audio

If you user as been added to one of this two groups, reboot the Rasberry Pi.

CLONE THE PROJECT FROM REPOSITORY
	$ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/inedit00/raspctl
	$ hg update stable

PRIVILEGED COMMANDS
If you want to use the "services" section (start/restart/... services in /etc/init.d/*)
you must execute the command below. For more information read the commands in the file
itself (I strongy recommend it):

sudo ./scripts/exec.sh deploy [user]

Being "user" the name of the user that will execute RaspCTL. The default is "pi".

STARTING THE APP
Must be started from the root directory of the application
	$ cd raspctl
	$ python core.py

You can now browse to http://your-rasppi-ip:8086/

DETACH APP FROM CONSOLE
If you want to execute the web application like if it were a daemon you can do:
	$ nohup python core.py &

DEVELOPERS
If somebody is interested in modify the code just have to run the DEPENDENCIES and STARTING THE APP
steps. If you have problems, drop me an email.

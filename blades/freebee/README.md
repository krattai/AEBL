freebee economy
===============

Freebee is a social experiment of a moneyless, debtless resource transaction system.

The Premise
Every individual has the potential to be self sustainable.  With that in mind, there is no real need for money or transactions between individuals.  What we do understand is that some people have, perhaps more, interest in and become more skilled at doing certain things, than others.

As a result, symbiotic relationships begin to develop in natural systems.  Like a plant that requires polination produces nectar to attract the bee, this symibotic loop is closed.  All parties benefit, and thrive.

Yet, in natural systems, there is no obligation to participate in symbiotic relationships with external systems.  It is a choice to do so.  A freedom.

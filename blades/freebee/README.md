freebee economy
===============

Freebee is a social experiment of a moneyless, debtless resource transaction system.

The Premise
Every individual has the potential to be self sustainable.  With that in mind, there is no real need for money or transactions between individuals.  What we do understand is that some people have, perhaps more, interest in and become more skilled at doing certain things, than others.

As a result, symbiotic relationships begin to develop in natural systems.  Like a plant that requires polination produces nectar to attract the bee, this symibotic loop is closed.  All parties benefit, and thrive.

Yet, in natural systems, there is no obligation to participate in symbiotic relationships with external systems.  It is a choice to do so.  A freedom.

The Problem
In a natural system, there is no problem.  These types of symbiotic relationships simply develop as agreed upon by those choosing to participate.

What really is the problem, is a societal.  Driven by some sense of fairness, which itself is based in a belief of self worth. which may be in conflict with a perceived obligation, or debt.  When a participant in a free system believe that they have more self worth than they are getting back from the relationship, a resentment begins to form.  It could be stated that this is the basis for all unrest in societies.

There are other potentially perceived problems which could present to a system at a later time, but they are all, ultimately, societal.  Those problems have solutions, that are outside the scope of of a symbiotic relationship.

The Solution
In a symbiotic relationship, all parties should be free to both opt in, and opt out, at any time.

Any solution cannot presume to be THE solution.  Rather any solution is ONE of many, potential solutions that could work on their own, or in conjunction with, other solutions.

The details of the freebee economy solution are ultimately quite simple.  People can opt in, or opt out of the system at any time.  Transactions can be one time or extended over periods of time and are dynamic and can change, as necessary or desired.  All that is required is that two or more parties agree to participate in some perceived, mutually beneficial relationship and no transaction or relationship is based on obligation or debt.

The easiest way to install BitTorrent is to run the install_nix.sh
script included in the source code.  The rest of these directions are
included for historical reasons.
----------------------------------------

Before installing BitTorrent 5.x, remove any older versions of the
BitTorrent client that may be installed.  This command will tell you
if you have an older version of BitTorrent installed:

ls -dl /usr/lib/python*/site-packages/BitTorrent* /usr/lib/python*/site-packages/khashmir*

Many of the following instructions require root privileges.


Prerequisites for installing BitTorrent on any generic UNIX system:
----------------------------------------
Install Python, version 2.3 or later. (2.4 recommended)
http://python.org/

Install wxWidgets, version 2.6 or later, in the Unicode flavor.
http://wxwidgets.org/

Install wxPython, version 2.6 or later, in the Unicode flavor.
http://wxpython.org/

Install GTK, version 2.6 or later.
http://gtk.org/

Install Twisted, version 2 or later.
http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/

Install PyCrypto, version 2 or later.

Install Psyco.
http://psyco.sourceforge.net/

Install Zope.Interface.
http://www.zope.org/Products/ZopeInterface

In all cases, it is STRONGLY recommended that you install these
packages using the standard package management system on your
particular distribution.

Next, be sure to remove any older versions of BitTorrent that may be
installed.  


How to install BitTorrent using Python's distutils system:
----------------------------------------
Install BitTorrent by running this from the root of the source code
directory:

$ python setup.py install


How to build a .deb format Debian package and install it:
----------------------------------------
First, remove any older versions of BitTorrent that may be installed:
(this command will also remove BitTornado)

$ sudo apt-get remove bittorrent bittorrent-gui

Build a proper deb using the following command:

$ sh build_nix_pkg.sh deb

then install the .deb:

$ sudo dpkg -i dist/bittorrent_5.x.y_python2.z.deb


How to build an .rpm format package and install it:
----------------------------------------
Generate an .rpm format package:

$ python setup.py bdist_rpm

Then install the .rpm:

$ sudo rpm -i dist/BitTorrent-5.x.y-1.noarch.rpm 


How to add BitTorrent as the default mime-type handler:
----------------------------------------
This step is optional.  Put a line in /etc/mailcap which is similar to
the following, only replace the path to /usr/bin/bittorrent.py with
the one it's actually in.

application/x-bittorrent; /usr/bin/bittorrent.py %s; test=test -n "$DISPLAY"

You may have to restart your web browser for it to start using
BitTorrent.

If you're using a web browser which doesn't respect /etc/mailcap you
can go into the mime-type configuration for your web browser and
manually associate application/x-bittorrent with btdownloadgui.py
(with the appropriate path, of course.)

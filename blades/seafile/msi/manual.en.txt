Welcome to use Seafile client.

Seafile client is used to download a "library" from a Seafile website, which is
different from other file sync service like dropbox.

1. Create a library on Seafile website;

2. Download the library from Seafile website;

3. Files added to this donwloaded library will automatically appear on Seafile website.

Don't add files to the "Seafile" folder. That would not make it appear on the website.

Objectives
===

Test the repo-encryption functionality. One should be able to upload
an encrypt repo, and fetch it elsewhere, and can checkout this repo
correctly as long as the right passwd is set.


Test
===

The test flow is 90% the same as the basic test. Only two steps are
different:

1. Use `seafile create --encrypt` to create an encrypted repo, rather
   than using a plain `seafile create`. You need to input the passwd
   manually.

2. After fetching is finished, use `seafile set-passwd` to set the
   passwd for the encrypted repo, and then checkout it.

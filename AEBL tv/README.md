The AEBL TV

The TV edition is a custom AEBL which uses the core, but is focused on funtions and tools that allow for TV-like functionalities.  This differs from the standard edition which is a core, and is oriented more to a broadcast, continuous play system for central services like behaviour as well as digital sign.  The TV edition provides necessary tools for active user interaction.

While the tool chain in the TV version can be integrated with the standard version, this image is for ease of setup for the specific feature set.

AEBL Mobile Media Player, changing how we consume media. AEBL is a media player and a digital media platform in use in the IHDN XPO network media system ( http://www.ihdn.ca/Xpo_VI.html ).

AEBL is foremost a mobile media distribution and playback framework.  It was created to be the core technology that is used in a television ad insertion and digital sign, and further development has opened up many more applications.  It currently is designed to run on a raspberry Pi, although it is being ported to other systems.

For those interested in trying it out, you will need a Raspberry Pi (should be the B series with 512MB) and a SD card (4GB or higher, recommend base 8GB but the larger, the better, for content storage).

The current image is a ~680MB 7zip compressed file of it's original 2.7GB size, located on dropbox, here:

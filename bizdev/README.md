AEBL Business Development
=========================

While AEBL has been developed as an Open Source project and is ultimately being done as a "labour of love" and for the benefit of everyone, how it is of value for each individual is certainly varied.

This area is focused on possible business development scenarios and opportunities.

There are at least two specific areas to look at:

1) Opportunity for the project to generate revenue in order to finance some portions of the project resources, perhaps as payment for human effort or perhaps to obtain technology resources to improve the technology of AEBL or support the project in some other ways.

2) Providing opportunity for others to use the AEBL platform to advance their own business or individual, financial gains.  This is generally an unspoken benefit and value of Open Source.  To be able to support others with the Open Source tool and knowledge, and to be paid for doing so.

So, this section will focus on providing resources, tools, and other information and support towards those ends.

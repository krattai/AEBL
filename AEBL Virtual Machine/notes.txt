The AEBL VM has a default user of pi and password of password

In order to shut down and power off the AEBL VM, log into the VM with username and password and type:

sudo poweroff

The AEBL VM has the user pi associated with super user and therefore can sudo a command without having to type the password for confirmation.  This was done for automation convenience and with the following:

sudo visudo

Adding this line at the end:

pi ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

If you wish to change this behaviour, remove that line.  Note:  This will cause certain features, such as updating (for security updates, for example) to stop working properly.

The AEBL Virtual Machine is a sister appliance to the AEBL core and system.

There are a number of reasons why a person or organization may want a virtual machine of the AEBL system, rather than an AEBL core appliance.  This may include, but not be limited to, development, scaling of certain AEBL features and blades, or desire of certain functions of the AEBL system without needing features that are part of the stand alone appliance.

The AEBL Virtual Machine will have most of the AEBL features, except those that can not function if due to the virtual machines inability to connect directly to a video or audio presentation device.

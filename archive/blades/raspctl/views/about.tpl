<h3>About</h3>

<hr />

<p> <b>RaspCTL</b> is side project. I needed an easy way to control my new Raspberry Pi and I decided to create a web admin for doing so. Basically I wanted to be able to execute <a href="/commands">commands</a> in a easy way, see some <a href="/">statics</a> about what's going on on the RaspPi, and later on I decided that it would be fun add a simple <a href="/webcam">webcam</a> support for taking snapshots and see what's going on in my room when I'm out (always absolutely nothing, of course....) </p>

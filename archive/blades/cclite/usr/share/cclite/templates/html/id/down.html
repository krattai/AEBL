Welcome to the test version of cclite. Until you've logged in, you can't do very much! Use a test account or create your own...<br/><br/>

You can use the Registry Name: <i>dalston</i> and Account Name: <i>ddawg</i> or <i>mmouse</i> both with Password: <i>test</i>. The currency <i>ducket</i> is set up for this registry.
<br/><br/>
Also you can use Account Name: <i>manager</i> with a Password: <i>manager</i> at dalston to access the Management Menu.<br/><br/>
You can add new registries and currencies with this. When you are logged in to dalston that currency will be added to dalston, for example.
<br/><br/>

Create a new account, if you like. It will need a valid email address to mail you an account confirmation link. Then click on that link to make the account active.<br/><br/>

There are plenty of rough edges, but all comments are welcome. I'm also putting news of progress into 
<a href="http://blog.bigwaveheuristics.com/index.php?cat=10">my blog</a>.

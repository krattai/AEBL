.SH NAME
xtfs_scrub \- checks for each file in a volume if the MRC file size is outdated and if the checksum of all objects is correct. The scrubber can also replace defective replicas in repair mode. 
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBxtfs_scrub [ \fIoptions\fB ] \fI<volume_name>\fB
.br

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I xtfs_scrub
performs a consistency check of each file in a given volume. If run without -repair or -delete it will only perform checks and report problems. Th scrubber checks for file if the file size on the OSDs is stored on the MRC and fixes inconsistencies if run in the -repair mode. In addition, the scrubber checks the checksum for each object of a file if the checksums are enabled on the OSD.

For replicated files the scrubber will check each replica for objects with inccorect checksum. In addition, it marks full replicas that successfully copied all objects as "complete" replicas. In the -repair mode, the scrubber will also replace replicas that contain ramoved OSDs. An OSD must be marked as dead/removed with the xtfs_chstatus tool, otherwise the scrubber will consider the OSD as temporarily unavailable and won't replace the replica.

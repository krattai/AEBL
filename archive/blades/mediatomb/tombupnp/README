the MediaTomb team are covered by LGPL, see README_LICENSE for more information.

Also note, that contrary to TombUPnP, MediaTomb sources are covered by the 
GPL license.

Allthough it is possible, TombUPnP is not meant to be used as a standalone
library. The motivation behind creating one more fork of the libupnp 
project is the independance that is requried to achieve rapid development
of the MediaTomb server.

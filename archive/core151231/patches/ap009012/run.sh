#
# This file will be superceded by the l-ctrl file as far as
# control of the system, as l-ctrl will be a cron job.  This
# script may become depricated, although it might continue a
# useful, future function for loose processes that are outside
# the scope of the l-ctrl function.
#
# This is control file that can change from time to time on admin
# desire.  This script is in addition to the getupdt.sh script
# only because the getupdt.sh script is assumed to be static
# where this one could contain a process which could update the
# getupdt.sh script if desired.
#
# Eventually, it would be nice to have this script create
# log or file to indicate that it completed successfully
# this would be the last command before a the script exits
# on a success rather than a fail exit
#
# There should be a control that allows system to be put into a
# live or a test condition.  Should be in at least in a cron job but
# eventually should be a daemon.
#
# This script is the one called from the getupdt.sh script and should
# probably make immediate determination between IHDN and AEBL systems
# and call respective scripts.
#
# This is the first script from clean bootup.  It should immediately
# put something to screen and audio so that people know it is working,
# and it should then loop that until it get's a .sysready lockfile.
#
# Utilize good bash methodologies as per:
# http://www.davidpashley.com/articles/writing-robust-shell-scripts/#id2382181

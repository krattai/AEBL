The AEBL core uses a rolling patch and upgrade system.

What that means is, when bug fixes, enhancements, and other code of interest should be introduced, it is, through the patch system.

An upgrade is basically an accumulation of all the patches, with any final code necessary to make the AEBL's current version, into an identical next version, as though it were freshly installed, except that content and logs are maintained.

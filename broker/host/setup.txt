AEBL is designed to ultimately be brokerless/stateless/p2p and so wouldn't generally have a primary server.  All devices would function as upstream hosts.

With that ideal, a brand new network would require a primary server to bootstrap the system.  Having a process and scripts to create this will be very useful.

May be able to use a persistent, public host service such IRC, github, etc.

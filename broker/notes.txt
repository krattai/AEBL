The notes contained in this folder are intended to express setting up a host for the AEBL broker and ultimately its conversion to a p2p broker system.

~~~~~~~~~~~

broker that was previously in play is now down, to be presumed permanently.

Need to set up new, temporary broker to be in place until p2p ready to go

~~~~~~~~~~

This may not be the best place for this, but as a reference, in the event an external drive is added to host and does not post (show), then the following may be helpful:

+ nb: specifically regarding sudo modprobe usb_storage

then mount drive:

And share drive:

Also point of interest regarding running and managing multiple kvm hosts, if relevant:

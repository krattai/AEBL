The AEBL Anarchy Edition

The Anarchy Edition is a custom AEBL which uses the core, but is focused on functions and tools that allow for anonymity, alt web, alt currencies and other capabilities.

While the tool chain in the AE version can be integrated with the standard version, this image is for ease of setup for the specific feature set.

This edition will integrate cryptopia and tlds such as bang, frx, and crpt

Also, this may disable the autoplay feature for ads and should enable SIP although it may autoplay channels by default or may have autoplay off in lieu of kodi.  This will be determined at later date.

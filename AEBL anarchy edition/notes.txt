In order to keep the base AEBL Virtual Machine file size as small as possible. it is not completely set up with all updates for the operating system and AEBL system.  This has the added capability to ensure that each new install is current with system and AEBL files at the time of installation.

For this reason, the first boot of an AEBL VM will take some time to get, update and install all relevant files and will not immediately be ready for use, until the process is completed.  In some cases, this may take as much as 1/2 an hour or more.

The AEBL VM has a default user of pi and password of password

In order to shut down and power off the AEBL VM, log into the VM with username and password and type:

sudo poweroff

The AEBL VM has the user pi associated with super user and therefore can sudo a command without having to type the password for confirmation.  This was done for automation convenience and with the following:

sudo visudo

Adding this line at the end:

pi ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

If you wish to change this behaviour, remove that line.  Note:  This will cause certain features, such as updating (for security updates, for example) to stop working properly.

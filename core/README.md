The AEBL core is the functional code that is required by an AEBL appliance to perform, for all intents and purposes, only the bare minimum activities, such as loading content onto the AEBL device and playing back that content.

The core also does contain code that allows a user to add and remove blades and interfaces, useful tools that enhance the functionality and ease of use of an AEBL appliance, if these tools had not been installed by way of a custom install.

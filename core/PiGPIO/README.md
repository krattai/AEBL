pigpio
======

pigpio is an extensive toolset that can be useful for those who wish to extend the functionality of their blades with add on hardware.

This specific PiGPIO code was released to public domain at the following github repository:
https://github.com/joan2937/pigpio/

NB:  The "license" used to release this associated code is at unlicense.org

There are some concerns over the legality and unencumbered nature of Public Domain and specifically the unlicense, so in the spirit of the unlicense, this code, by this declaration, can be now considered under the more recognized CC0 licnese.

Finally, while the actual text of the unlicense is simple and straightforward, many use the extended text which makes moral assertions about releasing the code to public domain to the gain of humanity, yet to the detriment of their heirs and successors, which is veritibly an oxymoron, as if it benefits humanity, then it also benefits to the same extent, any heirs and successors.

One need not make any such altruistic claims as those claims are, of themselves, non-altruistic, as they are self serving.

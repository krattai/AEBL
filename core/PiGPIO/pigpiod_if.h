/*TEXT

pigpiod_if is a C library for the Raspberry which allows control
of the gpios via the socket interface to the pigpio daemon. 

*Features*

o PWM on any of gpios 0-31

o servo pulses on any of gpios 0-31

o callbacks when any of gpios 0-31 change state

o callbacks at timed intervals

o reading/writing all of the gpios in a bank as one operation

o individually setting gpio modes, reading and writing

o notifications when any of gpios 0-31 change state

o the construction of output waveforms with microsecond timing

o rudimentary permission control over gpios

o a simple interface to start and stop new threads

o I2C, SPI, and serial link wrappers

o creating and running scripts on the pigpio daemon

*gpios*

ALL gpios are identified by their Broadcom number.

*Notes*

The PWM and servo pulses are timed using the DMA and PWM/PCM peripherals.

*Usage*

Include <pigpiod_if.h> in your source files.

Assuming your source is in prog.c use the following command to build

. .
gcc -o prog prog.c -lpigpiod_if
. .

to run make sure the pigpio daemon is running

. .
sudo pigpiod

 ./prog # sudo is not required to run programs linked to pigpiod_if
. .

For examples see x_pigpiod_if.c within the pigpio archive file.

*Notes*

All the functions which return an int return < 0 on error

. .

Returns 0 if OK, otherwise PI_BAD_USER_GPIO, PI_BAD_PULSEWIDTH or
PI_NOT_PERMITTED.

The selected pulsewidth will continue to be transmitted until
changed by a subsequent call to set_servo_pulsewidth.

The pulsewidths supported by servos varies and should probably be
determined by experiment. A value of 1500 should always be safe and
represents the mid-point of rotation.

You can DAMAGE a servo if you command it to move beyond its limits.

OTHER UPDATE RATES:

This function updates servos at 50Hz.  If you wish to use a different
update frequency you will have to use the PWM functions.

. .
Update Rate (Hz)     50   100  200  400  500
1E6/Hz            20000 10000 5000 2500 2000
. .

Firstly set the desired PWM frequency using [*set_PWM_frequency*].

Then set the PWM range using [*set_PWM_range*] to 1E6/Hz.
Doing this allows you to use units of microseconds when setting
the servo pulse width.

E.g. If you want to update a servo connected to gpio 25 at 400Hz

. .
set_PWM_frequency(25, 400);
set_PWM_range(25, 2500);
. .

Thereafter use the [*set_PWM_dutycycle*] function to move the servo,
e.g. set_PWM_dutycycle(25, 1500) will set a 1500 us pulse.

Only one watchdog may be registered per gpio.

Type 2 has gpio 2 on P1-3, gpio 3 on P1-5, gpio 27 on P1-13, and
gpios 28-31 on P5.

Type 3 has a 40 pin connector rather than the 26 pin connector of
the earlier boards. Gpios 0 to 27 are brought out to the connector.

Type 1 boards have hardware revision numbers of 2 and 3.

Type 2 boards have hardware revision numbers of 4, 5, 6, and 15.

This function creates a waveform from the data provided by the prior

As many waveforms may be created as there is space available.  The
wave id is passed to [*wave_send_**] to specify the waveform to transmit.

Normal usage would be

Step 1. [*wave_clear*] to clear all waveforms and added data.

Step 2. [*wave_add_**] calls to supply the waveform data.

Step 3. [*wave_create*] to create the waveform and get a unique id

Repeat steps 2 and 3 as needed.

Step 4. [*wave_send_**] with the id of the waveform to transmit.

A waveform comprises one or more pulses.  Each pulse consists of a
[*gpioPulse_t*] structure.

typedef struct
{
   uint32_t gpioOn;
   uint32_t gpioOff;
   uint32_t usDelay;

2) the gpios to be switched off at the start of the pulse. 
3) the delay in microseconds before the next pulse. 

Any or all the fields can be zero.  It doesn't make any sense to
set all the fields to zero (the pulse will be ignored).

When a waveform is started each pulse is executed in order with the
specified delay between the pulse and the next.

sed examples:
ip addr show eth0 | sed 's/://g' | sed 's/\/64//' | awk '/inet6 / {print $2}'

sed 's/%//' file > newfile
echo "68%" | sed "s/%$//" #assume % is always at the end.
echo "82%%%" | sed 's/%*$//'
echo "/this/is/my/path////" | sed 's!/*$!!'
echo $string | sed 's/[\._-]//g'
echo ${string//[-._]/}

this removes all instances
echo "8%2%%%" | sed 's/%//g'

Notes on web interfaces:

First part from:
http://raspberrywebserver.com/cgiscripting/setting-up-nginx-and-uwsgi-for-cgi-scripting.html

sudo apt-get install nginx

sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default

I don't believe I actually made changes to default, but eventually it started, although not sure if before or after:

sudo service nginx restart

Apparently, this doesn't work properly due to not cgi configed:
sudo apt-get install uWSGI

so:
curl http://uwsgi.it/install | bash -s cgi /home/pi/uwsgi

This will probably take about 20 or more minutes as it builds,
may want to do this process post install, during video looping

Which means this may not be required:
sudo mkdir /usr/lib/cgi-bin

OK, should clean up from curl and install, so this might be necessary:
rm  uwsgi_latest_from_installer.tar.gz
rm -rf uwsgi_latest_from_installer

/home/pi/uwsgi_config.ini:
[uwsgi]
plugins = cgi
socket = 127.0.0.1:9000
chdir = /usr/lib/cgi-bin/
module = pyindex
cgi=/cgi-bin=/usr/lib/cgi-bin/
cgi-helper =.py=python

And this may be invalid, as uwsgi may now be ./uwsgi:
First did not work, second did:
sudo -u www-data ./uwsgi ./uwsgi_config.ini
sudo -u www-data uwsgi ./uwsgi_config.ini

And taking cue from raspCTL, make the app basically into daemon:
nohup sudo -u www-data ./uwsgi ./uwsgi_config.ini &

sudo nano /usr/lib/cgi-bin/hello.py

sudo chmod +x /usr/lib/cgi-bin/hello.py

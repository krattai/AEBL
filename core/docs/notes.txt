Wishlist and other, non-code notes:

Set beta system to test code in field, without affecting production systems.
+ and patch them every hour.

Find way to automate things by text / email.

Code examples:

sed examples:
ip addr show eth0 | sed 's/://g' | sed 's/\/64//' | awk '/inet6 / {print $2}'

sed 's/%//' file > newfile
echo "68%" | sed "s/%$//" #assume % is always at the end.
echo "82%%%" | sed 's/%*$//'
echo "/this/is/my/path////" | sed 's!/*$!!'
echo $string | sed 's/[\._-]//g'
echo ${string//[-._]/}

this removes all instances
echo "8%2%%%" | sed 's/%//g'

Notes on web interfaces:

First part from:
http://raspberrywebserver.com/cgiscripting/setting-up-nginx-and-uwsgi-for-cgi-scripting.html

sudo apt-get install nginx

sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default

I don't believe I actually made changes to default, but eventually it started, although not sure if before or after:

sudo service nginx restart

Apparently, this doesn't work properly due to not cgi configed:
sudo apt-get install uWSGI

so:
curl http://uwsgi.it/install | bash -s cgi /home/pi/uwsgi

This will probably take about 20 or more minutes as it builds,
may want to do this process post install, during video looping

Which means this may not be required:
sudo mkdir /usr/lib/cgi-bin

OK, should clean up from curl and install, so this might be necessary:
rm  uwsgi_latest_from_installer.tar.gz
rm -rf uwsgi_latest_from_installer

/home/pi/uwsgi_config.ini:
[uwsgi]
plugins = cgi
socket = 127.0.0.1:9000
chdir = /usr/lib/cgi-bin/
module = pyindex
cgi=/cgi-bin=/usr/lib/cgi-bin/
cgi-helper =.py=python

And this may be invalid, as uwsgi may now be ./uwsgi:
First did not work, second did:
sudo -u www-data ./uwsgi ./uwsgi_config.ini
sudo -u www-data uwsgi ./uwsgi_config.ini

And taking cue from raspCTL, make the app basically into daemon:
nohup sudo -u www-data ./uwsgi ./uwsgi_config.ini &

sudo nano /usr/lib/cgi-bin/hello.py

sudo chmod +x /usr/lib/cgi-bin/hello.py

String manipulation with bash:

http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/string-manipulation.html

http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2010/07/bash-string-manipulation/

Manipulating strings, character by character, with sed, from:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10551981/how-to-perform-a-for-loop-on-each-character-in-a-string-in-bash

```
$ echo "Hello world" | sed -e 's/\(.\)/\1\n/g'
H
e
l
l
o

w
o
r
l
d
```

String manipulation in loop, one char at a time:

```
foo=string
for (( i=0; i<${#foo}; i++ )); do
  echo ${foo:$i:1}
done
```

and

```
while test -n "$words"; do
   c=${words:0:1}     # Get the first character
   echo character is $c
   words=${words:1}   # trim the first character
done
```

To force resotion and HDMI audio:

omxplayer -o hdmi -r /home/ads/FacePaintingMaster.mp4

keyboard set to US 104 key

/boot/config.txt has the following set to enable 480i:

hdmi_group=1
hdmi_mode=6

Although monitor still states the resolution is different

~~~~~~

Need to review and update installer and patch software

~~~~~~

Start looking at using omxd as advanced playback

~~~~~~

Check installation of AEBL and then using ctrl commands to set devices types

~~~~~~

Look at securing non-generic devices using web interface, etc

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For auto connect on first boot and autodiscover, should use a trust level.  Both node and server will be at trust level 0 until formally authorized by some method of challenge response, human intervention, or similar.  Could use an auth token to indicate device has been authenticated either on the local network or on the licensed network.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

check if gogo6 not authenticating anonymous on hosts.  If not, in /etc/gogoc/gogoc.conf set:
server=anon-montreal.freenet6.net

possibly put anon- prefix on servers in /var/lib/gogoc/tsp-broker-list.txt

~~~~

Use method to auto assign channel and register via mqtt
Use same method to register for noo-ebs locale

~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Might be intersting to set up console tool.

Could do so using Newt:

How to post to google+ using google api ???

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Added Lua intro to docs as a, possibly just, temporary reference

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Need to work on aggregating source content, including on dynamic IPs, which would mean parsing messages and updating cloud / torrent seeds

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to read header info of video (or audio) file, use ffmpeg.  In the event that AEBL and associated devices are on Jessie, the libav-tools is the alternative.

ffmpeg -i bpgameday00.mp4
avconv -i bpgameday00.mp4

to extract length / duration:

ffmpeg -i bpgameday00.mp4 2>&1 | grep Duration | cut -d ' ' -f 4 | sed s/,//
avconv -i bpgameday00.mp4 2>&1 | grep Duration | cut -d ' ' -f 4 | sed s/,//

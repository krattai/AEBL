INSTALLATION
============

## INSTALL

The below installation procedure will install and start the daemon,
make it auto-start at reboot, install its manual page and set up
logrotate for its logfile /var/log/omxlog.
You need the 'git', 'gcc' and 'make' packages to perform the installation.

 git clone https://github.com/subogero/omxd.git
 cd omxd
 make

If you want to run omxplayer as an unprivileged user, create /etc/omxd.conf

 sudo echo 'user=foo' > /etc/omxd.conf

Make sure the user is part of the audio and video groups.

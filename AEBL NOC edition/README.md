The AEBL NOC Edition

The NOC Edition is a custom AEBL which uses the core, but is focused on functions and tools that allow for network connectivity persistence and resiliance.

While the tool chain in the NOC version can be integrated with the standard version, this image is for ease of setup for the specific feature set.

NOC Edition will utilize alternate DNS methods to maintain resiliance by utilizing existing alt-DNS groups, such as:
freeNIC - http://freenic.org/
OpenNIC - http://opennicproject.org/

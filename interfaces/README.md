interfaces
==========

Interfaces are AEBL addons which add certain control aspects to an AEBL.  They are different than blades in that they are not likely to be installed on an AEBL directly, rather they communicate with an AEBL and its existing functionalities.

Like blades, these might include backend services such as web controllers, messaging services, tunneling, or smart phone controllers.

This is a great way for people to help with and add to the project, which enhances the device in innovative ways.

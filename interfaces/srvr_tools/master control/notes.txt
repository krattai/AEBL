initial mockup should be console based management tool

rethinking this, as for many users, a browser based tool might be better and faster to create

will need back end automation as well as front end interaction

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Might want to use base config file for p2p services stored on github

Need to consider server side scripts in order to manage master control functions

Server should function as p2p broker as necessary

Need to keep track of status of appliances to ensure they are functioning

master control should at least be viewable by web browser but would also like an application as master control, as well.

Need to look at nanomsg as a alternative or complimentary service
